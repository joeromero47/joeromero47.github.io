I just completed my first CLI project and I'm feeling reinvigorated and motivated to continue learning. I felt a little out of place while completing labs because I didn't know if I was actually learning the material but I do want to say I absorbed more than I thought.  Putting everything into practice showed me how much I learned as well as didn't learn. There were moments where I felt completely lost but my cohort and the cohort lead Michael proved to be valuable resources to help me when I got stuck. My 1on1 with Michael really set me on the right track and helping understand how I should be thinking as a programmer.
