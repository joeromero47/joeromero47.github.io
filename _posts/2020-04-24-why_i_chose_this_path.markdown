I decided to pick up programing for many reasons. The first was definitely because I wanted to get out of my current career track. I no longer wanted to be in traditional customer service. I worked nearly 4 years as an insurance claims adjuster and it just wasnt for me. I wasn't being challenenged and I felt replaceable. I've always loved computers. I built my first computer about 4 years ago and I loved every moment of it. I finally wanted to learn how to make things in the computer.
