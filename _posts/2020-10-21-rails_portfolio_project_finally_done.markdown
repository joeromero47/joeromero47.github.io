This project was definitely the most difficult one by far. However, I also felt the most confident going into this one than any other project yet. I brainstormed some ideas on what I wanted my project to be and ended up on an app called Game Ratings. This app allows you to crete a game and then assign a score. I created 3 models or classes. A User, Game and ratings class. The game class was functionally my join table and had editable characteristics such as :title and :genre. I created the rating or :score attribute separately in it's own class as I wanted to expand it in the future to also accept reviews and comments and felt that it would be easier with it's own class as a user could access a review or rating directly without needing to view a game prior. 

Overall, this project expanded my idea of what I'm capable of in creating an app.
