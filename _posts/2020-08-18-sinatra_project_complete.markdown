I have climbed a huge mountain going into this project. Unfortunately, leading into this project I was riddled with anxiety and imposter syndrome because a lot of the content was becoming increasingly difficult. I doubted myself a lot but when I look back at it I feel silly because it's obvious I could have done it because I now have done it. It's just a lesson showing that when things look impossible, they aren't. Regardless of what you tell yourself. 

Perhaps the most difficult concept about this project was routing. It took some time to really understand that each http request was independent and new and that data wasn't easily shared between them. Creating a method to call up the data I wanted(in this instance, the list of games that belonged to the user) made the work much more easier to navigate. I was able to successfully put that method at the beginning of most of my routes and was able to use my erb/html files to display the correct information. 

I'm glad I survived thsi project and it makes me hopeful to reach the next!
